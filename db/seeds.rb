Aries gets Aries, because Aries knows Aries, because Aries IS Aries. So, of course Aries is going to understand why their partner always needs to be the boss, always wants to lead, and always wants exciting fireworks around. And Aries doesn't waste time, nor does it like anybody else that does. So this is yet another beautiful thing about this match.
    Aries is also very independent. And does NOT like the kind of mate that needs to text them 50 times before lunch about what they are going to have for lunch. So this is a sign that really appreciates that in another Aries. Aries also loves pursuing, but they also love being pursued, which comes in handy when their mate is another initiator as well. There is no time wasted with Aries and that will work out very well for both of you.",

You can't both be the boss all the time. This is without question an enthusiastic and positive union, but you are going to butt heads once in a while. Aries is symbolized by the Ram, and so if there is any sign that is going to butt heads with you, it is going to be your fellow Aries. Consider yourself warned when you start mating with an Aries, the clash of the egos is inevitable, and will likely be the thing the two of you fight about the most.
    Being Cardinal Fire Signs, tempers will also flare with Aries matches. But you know how to handle fire in your earthly life, they are easily quashed with the right extinguisher. Same thing applies to an Aries upon Aries explosion. Soften the blows and the sparks with the positive traits of Aries, generosity and indulgences, and the fire won't last long.",

Yes you will argue, but if you are going into a love experience expecting it to be perfect ALL the time, I'm telling you right now it is going to fizzle out, whether you are an Aries or not. The beautiful thing about Aries is that as fire signs, it ALWAYS fizzles out, and it usually fizzles out pretty quickly if you remember the positive traits in each other, and nurture each other through those fiery wars when they do erupt. Note I did not say if, but when. It's going to happen, prepare yourself, and be the best loving partner you can be, and that fire won't last long. One thing you two are never going to be short of is passion, so use your spontaneous side to your advantage, and when the fiery wars begin, let them be overcome with passion. By the time all is said and done, you'll forget what you were even fighting about.",

Taurus looks for someone that goes after what they want in life, and will love this quality the most in Aries, not to mention Aries unrelenting passion. Taurus also offers security and a long-term vision, that Aries loves in both work and play. If Aries can have a partner to come home to that will never keep them guessing what game they are playing next, they will love that quality the most in their Taurus.

Independent warrior Aries will have little to no patience for that. Who needs to bend on these matters? They both do. Taurus needs to learn flexibility and that life is not fixed on one mission at all times, while Aries needs to use a little extra energy to remind Taurus, frequently, that their fire doesn't necessarily mean they are a wanderer. Aries will also need to accept that they can't get their way, ALL the time, if they want this match to work.",

The more committed these two are to learning more about each other and how to make it work, the greater the chance they have at creating a balance between impulsivity and groundedness.

Aries may have a problem with Leo's flirty nature, and constant need for attention, but Aries will find that all of that is superficial. If Leo has declared love to Aries, there will be little if anything that Aries can do to change their mind. Aries also loves Leo's loyal side, and highly respects how this commands a strong friendship with this match.

Both of these signs are also extremely independent, which Aries will really appreciate. Aquarius will as well!

There is a very special bond between this pair, and a deep understanding between them that is star crossed to stand the test of time.",

Aquarius will definitely have a problem with that, and this will lead Aries temper to come rising to the occasion. And when Aquarius gets burned, their response is often, 'You are dead to me.' And as Fixed Signs, they mean it. So Aries does need to tread lightly here. At the same time, Aquarius can work on understanding the possessive side of Aries and taking it as a compliment, rather than as a lack of trust. Aquarius may not always be up for the active energy that Aries needs to use up every day, as Aquarius is more active mentally. Finding the balance in love between thinking and doing will be something both in this match will need to work on.",

Aquarius will be very good as well at keeping Aries on task and en point when it comes to completing tasks or even requests in love, and should continue to do this in order to see their relationship thrive. Aries on the other hand should pull back from the jealousy and possessiveness, and realize that once their fixed sign gets a fix on them, they are in it for the long haul. When both of these signs can overcome these individual insecurities, theirs is truly a cosmic connection.",

For this one to be a match for the long term, Pisces needs to go with the flow emotionally as well, and be flexible on that front and not take so much so personally. Aries as well can direct this with their leadership skills, but also needs to pull back on the jumping to conclusions. Both Aries and Pisces are also incredibly independent, when they give each other exactly the freedom they need, this match will grow and flourish. Aries needs to let Pisces retreat to the cave once in a while without feeding their jealousy bone. Pisces needs to remember Aries can't read their mind when they are upset about something.

Gemini is also a Mutable sign, and may have a bit of a wandering eye, or at least a desire to flirt around.

Gemini on the other hand needs to realize that if Taurus seems obsessive and jealous, it is a great sign that they are absolutely crazy about them, and as a Fixed Sign, that often means for life. Gemini also needs to remember that trying to snow their Taurus is going to backfire big time, and Gemini just needs to have some security and confidence in themselves to show their real self to Taurus.

But this same quality as fierce as it will make fights some time will also ignite the sparks of passion the Taurus Leo match is known for. The makeup sex will be out of this world, another reason this pair does not want to let the other go any time soon.

Both are very passionate and sensual, and will have no problem creating sparks with each other from the get go. That there is a lot different between this pair is actually what will make it work, as both will love what they learn about each other and will become stronger not just as an individual but as a couple together through the years.",

Taurus and Capricorn understand each other very well, as they are both dedicated, strong and hard workers, and are as loyal and as dependable as the day is long. Taurus is a hard worker that loves pretty things, and Capricorn admires that and works just as hard if not harder to provide those pretty things to Taurus. Both are not wild partygoers either, and so there will be many long and quiet nights in for this pair, and they will both be perfectly fine with that. Capricorn will appreciate the warm and loving energy that Taurus brings to this union, and Taurus will adore having someone so real that they can always count on. It is not the most exciting match, but a very fulfilling one to both because they will always be able to count on each other.",

Taurus also finds Capricorn a little too conservative and rigid at times, and the phrase 'Lighten up!' will be a common one in their fights. Capricorn isn't a great friend of drama, and particularly won't like how once Taurus gets their hooks on something, they are like a dog with a bone that won't let it go. There also isn't a lot of sexual chemistry here, but a strong foundation of love and dedication that will often surpass any areas of weakened chemistry.",

Taurus will need to enjoy Capricorn's ethic and desire to provide everything they need, and not take Capricorn's work time as a personal slight. If Taurus is finding Capricorn too conservative or stubborn, Taurus should take the lead on bringing fun into the union by planning as many sexy nights in as possible. At the end of the day, communicating with each other like real friends is a strength of the Taurus and Capricorn love match that can ride it out for decades of anniversaries if that is what they want.

Overall, with a double Earth Sign love match, you have a practical and responsible relationship. These qualities are the strengths of both of these zodiac signs, and so to many this pairing may even seem dull.

Both of these signs are innately jealous as well, but Aquarius has a more unconventional approach to that that will not be taken lightly by Taurus.

Pisces also appreciates the down to Earth and real nature of Taurus, and also that Taurus is loyal.

Taurus as well will need to earn this flexibility from Pisces however, and can do so by giving their Pisces as much room as they are comfortable with. In other words, the Taurus jealousy streak needs to be kept at bay, despite the fact that Pisces will be the most flexible with it. Taurus is also well known for their temper, and Pisces for their hurt feelings. Taurus will need to keep this in check, if they want to keep their Pisces in check as well.

And Gemini can cut it like a sword but they really can't take the blow and will harbor a grudge for a very long time. Being Mutable works to their advantage, but this relationship at the long term level has the potential to build a path of resentment over time. As well, loyalty is not often the word that is used to describe Gemini. Being Mutable means they often flit from one flower to the next, even when they shouldn't.

If this pair can establish a pattern of communicating with love first on a regular basis, it will be a very exciting match indeed.

They fall easily into the forgive and forget crowd, so long as you say you are sorry when you need to. Two Geminis together pose a very strong reading on the love compatibility, and they have a great shot for the long haul together.

Communicating through every thick and thin will be the greatest armour that will help this love match wage through many battles together, and come out even stronger.

Both of these signs bring some very unique gifts to the table when it comes to love, and although they present them rather differently, there is a lot of love between them that will help them overcome these differences. One thing about Scorpio is that their loyalty is almost unmatched. And as a mutable sign, Gemini forgives even sooner than the words 'Im Sorry' are out of Scorpio's mouth. So as heated as this match can be, love and forgiveness will keep it going for as long as they want it to.

Capricorn needs to think things over, and doesn't have a problem coming to decisions. So Capricorn may have a problem with Libra's inability to come to a firm decision, while Libra will get upset with Capricorn's pushy nature of making a concrete plan. While both zodiac signs are hard workers, Libra likes to enjoy her time off with her mate and getting Capricorn out of the office will be difficult more times than it will not. Libra could get manipulative about this, which Capricorn will have zero tolerance for.

In order for this match to work, both Scorpio and Scorpio need to put their intuitive feelers onto their partner's needs every single day. Scorpio needs to feel secure in love, and can get this for themselves by assuring their partner of the same security they crave.

    pro: "There is a beautiful personal chemistry between Sagittarius and Aquarius that is evident to almost anyone that meets them, right off the bat. This is a match that could easily become love at first sight, because Air and Fire combined really do get along quite well. They are both excited and impassioned by each other just at first glance, and they will not know why. So exploring this together will be a marker of the Sagittarius and Aquarius match. Sagittarius is ruled by Jupiter and Aquarius is ruled by Uranus. They both have an interest in spontaneous and unexpected things. They both have a lot of energy to offer the other as well when it comes to going from one place to another to try and experience these new things the world has to offer. There is a truth seeking undertone to this relationship, and so both will appreciate long talks with each other. Sagittarius will be turned on by the intellectual nature of Aquarius, and how much Aquarius has to tell them about the big world. Aquarius on the other hand will be attracted to the drive that Sagittarius has in showing that big world. There are a lot of romantic sparks and romantic similarities between the Sagittarius and Aquarius match to give it heat and steam for as long as they want it to last.",
    con: "If there are problems in the Sagittarius and Aquarius love compatibility it will lie in the differences in their overall nature. Sagittarius is a mutable sign, a natural wanderer, and a bit of a flirt. Aquarius is a Fixed Sign, and does not look at more than one person at a time. Fixed Signs can also be a bit on the jealous side, and Aquarius doesn't have the time to deal with jealousy. Sagittarius will need to keep this flirting side at bay, or at least keep the flirts going in the direction of their Aquarius, if they don't want Aquarius to move on. As a Fixed Sign Aquarius likes to stay in one place as well. This is exactly the opposite of what Sagittarius wants to do. So unless Sagittarius and Aquarius can come to a middle ground here, this is an area that will cause some conflict in this romance down the road.",
    maximize: "There is very little advice that Sagittarius and Aquarius need in order to make things work. This is a truth seeking pair that is very skilled at talking things out. In order for this Air and Fire combination to be making sparks at the long term level, they both will need to make some concessions in some areas. Aquarius needs to pull back on the jealousies and the obsessive natures, and Sagittarius needs to work harder at helping Aquarius feel secure in this relationship. As a Mutable Sign Sagittarius is the flexible one, and this will come easier to Sagittarius. Their shared vision of overall peace in humanity will ensure that whatever few problems arise here, won't last long. Well that and, their amazing sexual chemistry.",

Here we have the Mutable Fire Sign of Sagittarius pairing with the Fixed Air Sign of Aquarius. We always say when Air and Fire combine, sparks fly, and that's because they do! This is a pair with a very good sexual chemistry, they will not be able to keep their hands off each other. Their shared visions will help if they want a long term connection as well. There will be some unnecessary outside flirting in play in this romance, which could lead to some jealousies. Both Sagittarius and Aquarius will need to find a way to ensure each other feels secure and appreciated, and they will be able to create sparks for decades if they so choose.",

With the Mutable Fire energy of Sagittarius we have an inspired and creative and passionate individual who seems to have everything that Pisces is looking for. Pisces is a dreamer and always conceptualizing about the big broad world, Sagittarius is a doer and shows Pisces that big bad world. Sagittarius is ruled by Jupiter and is always thinking and philosophizing out loud. Pisces on the other hand is ruled by Neptune, and thinks more about these things on an internal level, but really appreciates the expansive mindset that Sagittarius brings to the table. Pisces also really likes how open and friendly Sagittarius is, and life with Sagittarius will always seem 'easy' to Pisces, which is exactly what Pisces wants. Both signs are mutable as well, and so although this is sometimes a case of opposites attract, they both move on from drama and strife almost as quickly as it crops up. Neither likes to dwell on anything and both Sagittarius and Pisces really appreciate that about each other!",

There are however a lot of differences between the Sagittarius and Pisces match that could threaten the relationship. As a Fire Sign, Sagittarius has a lot of energy and is always moving and shaking from one place to the next. Pisces is the exact opposite, and you are more likely to find Pisces in a cave on any given day, than you will find them bar hopping with Sagittarius. Pisces is also easily wounded, and as forgiving as they are, Sagittarius will find this very draining. The slower pace of watery Pisces could also put some water on the fire of Sagittarius spirit, which Sagittarius will not at all appreciate. Both of these Mutable Signs are also not known to be the most loyal and commitment worthy signs. So both Sagittarius and Pisces are in danger of having a partner with wandering eyes, unless they set boundaries early on. And boundaries, is often the exact opposite of what a Mutable Sign wants.",
    maximize: "One thing that Sagittarius and Pisces have going for them is that they are both Mutable Signs, and thus easygoing by nature. If they decide to come together in love compatibility, it will likely have to be something major that will break them up. Neither Sagittarius nor Pisces needs to dominate, and this creates a happy and harmonious love balance right from the beginning. They both have big dreams when it comes to sexual intimacy as well, so this pair will never be short of chemistry either. Their best bet for success is when they get on the same page as early as possible with each other, no matter what that page is, and if they can, they will certainly create some sexy steam together, for some time to come.",

Where these two zodiac signs will differ will not seem like a big deal to either most of the time, since they both are mutable and by nature easygoing. If Sagittarius and Pisces want this to last the test of time, they will need to have an honest conversation about that in the beginning, and will then be able to create as much steam as they want together, for as long as they both shall live.",

Both of these signs are successful in their line of work, and are skilled communicators. Each Capricorn will be very grateful to the other for being able to talk about challenges that arise. They both will also be turned on by the sensual and earthy nature of their personalities.

Both of these individuals are used to being the boss, and not everyone can be the boss all of the time in love. As Capricorn is represented by the Goat, this may mean that goat horns are going to lock on more than one occasion. This couple is also very conservative in their approach to almost everything. So this could cause some wrinkles when one is hoping to have the other open up, as both Capricorns in this match will be slow to do so. If either Capricorn is looking for a fast paced relationship, they may be disappointed or frustrated with this one.",

When problems arise, both Capricorn and Capricorn need to handle them with a strategy and diplomacy that both parties will ultimately be happy with.

Here we have two of the same zodiac sign with many similarities joining at the table.

Although both Capricorn and Aquarius go about this in different ways, they are really turned on by this trait in the other. Capricorn is a goal oriented one, and Aquarius is attracted to this and to the social status that Capricorn has to offer. Aquarius is ruled by the unusual Uranus, and Capricorn will appreciate the quirks and intellectual approach that Aquarius takes to life.

Aquarius likes the same thing in Capricorn, and will also inspire Capricorn to engage in a dreamier side of life on occasion.",

Aquarius as a Fixed Sign is not one to budge from theirs, and so Capricorn will be doing a lot of bending of the will on occasion, which will be very uncomfortable. Capricorn also finds Aquarius a little too out of the box sometimes, Capricorn likes things predictable and stable. Being ruled by Uranus, Aquarius is anything but, and this could get on Capricorn's nerves more than once. Aquarius also does not like to be controlled or dominated, and this only comes naturally to Capricorn.",

So Pisces may become frustrated with Capricorn's rational approach, and Capricorn may become tired or overwhelmed with Pisces emotional approach.

The strong will of Aquarius as well is not one that Pisces will favor, as Pisces doesn't like to be pushed or coerced into anything. At the same time, overly dramatic emotional displays that Pisces is known for, will not fly with the rational Aquarius.

If one is in the relationship at a different pace than the other, this could cause some problems in love. Additionally mutable signs, and particularly Pisces, have a sense of wandering in love for this very reason. When conflict arises Pisces disappears, and sometimes even when it doesn't.
